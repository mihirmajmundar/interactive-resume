# interactive resume builder
In this project, I have build the resume using javascript. index.html has framework or placeholder for data. 
resumebuilder.js file has jason data which stored all information and thru javascript placing the data in the nice format.
If you want to play around, change the json data in resumebuilder.js file and resume will change. No need to change anything on html page.
Have fun....
